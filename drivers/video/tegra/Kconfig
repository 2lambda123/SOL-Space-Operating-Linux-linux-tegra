	  Say Y here to include the memory management driver for the Tegra
	  GPU, multimedia and display subsystems

	bool "Virtualize IOVMM memory in nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && (TEGRA_IOVMM || IOMMU_API)
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable nvmap to reclaim I/O virtual memory after
	  it has been unpinned, and re-use it for other handles. This can
	  allow a larger virtual I/O VM space than would normally be
	  supported by the hardware, at a slight cost in performance.

config NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM
	bool "Allow physical system memory to be used by nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to allow nvmap to use physical system memory (i.e.,
	  shared with the operating system but not translated through
	  an IOVMM device) for allocations.

	bool "Use only HIGHMEM for nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && (NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM || TEGRA_IOVMM || IOMMU_API) && HIGHMEM

	bool "Reclaim nvmap carveout by killing processes"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP

	  Say Y here to allow the system to reclaim carveout space by killing
	  processes. This will kill the largest consumers of lowest priority
	  first.

config NVMAP_CARVEOUT_COMPACTOR

	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  say Y here to reduce the alloction overhead, which is significant
	  for uncached, writecombine and inner cacheable memories as it
	  involves changing page attributes during every allocation per page
	  and flushing cache. Alloc time is reduced by allcoating the pages
	  ahead and keeping them aside. The reserved pages would be released
	  when system is low on memory and acquired back during release of
	  memory.
