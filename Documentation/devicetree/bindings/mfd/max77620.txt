* MAX77620 Power management IC.

Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible: Must be "maxim,max77620".
- reg: I2C device address.
- interrupt-controller: MAX77620 has internal interrupt controller which takes the
  interrupt request from internal sub-blocks like RTC, regulators, GPIOs as well
  as external input.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be set to 2 for IRQ number and flags.
  The first cell is the IRQ number. IRQ numbers for different interrupt source
  of AS3722 are defined at dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h
  The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from binding document
	interrupts.txt, using dt-bindings/irq.

Optional properties:
-------------------

Optional submodule and their properties:
=======================================

Flexible power sequence configuration
====================================
This sub-node configure the FPS of the device. Device has 3 FPS as FPS0, FPS1
and FPS2. The FPS sub node name is "fps" and their child has register property
to reprsent FPS number.
The property for fps child nodes as:
Required properties:
	-reg: FPS number like 0, 1, 2 for FPS0, FPS1 and FPS2 respectively.
Optinal properties:
	-maxim,fps-time-period: U32 for the FPS time period.
	-maxim,fps-enable-input: FPS enable source like EN0, EN1 or SW. The
			macros are defined on dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h for
			different enable source.
				FPS_EN_SRC_EN0 for EN0 enable source.
				FPS_EN_SRC_EN1 for En1 enable source.
				FPS_EN_SRC_SW for SW based control.
	-maxim,fps-sw-enable: Boolean, applicable if enable input is SW.
			If this property present then enable the FPS else
			disable FPS.

Example:
--------
#include <dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h>
...
max77620@3c {
	compatible = "maxim,max77620";
	reg = <0x3c>;

	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <0 86 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;

	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;

	fps {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		fps@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			maxim,fps-time-period = <100>;
			maxim,fps-enable-input = <FPS_EN_SRC_EN0>;
		};

		fps@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			maxim,fps-time-period = <100>;
			maxim,fps-enable-input = <FPS_EN_SRC_EN1>;
		};

		fps@2 {
			reg = <2>;
			maxim,fps-time-period = <100>;
			maxim,fps-enable-input = <FPS_EN_SRC_SW>;
		};
	};
};
