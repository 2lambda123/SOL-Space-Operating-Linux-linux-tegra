NVIDIA Tegra DVFS rail data in the board DTS file:

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be one of the following
	"nvidia,tegra210-dvfs-rail"

- vdd_cpu-supply : Must contain phandle pointing to the regulator for CPU rail.
- vdd_gpu-supply : Must contain phandle pointing to the regulator for GPU rail.
- vdd_core-supply : Must contain phandle pointing to the regulator for SoC rail.

One and only one of the above properties must be specified for each rail node.

Optional properties:
- vdd_cpu_dfll-supply : Must contain phandle pointing to the regulator for CPU
rail in DFLL closed loop mode. This property is required if 'vdd_cpu-supply'
property is pointing to fixed regulator node. Otherwise, it is ignored.

-reg : Can be any number but same as used in the node name

DVFS rail nodes can be placed at root, or included into dvfs-rails parent node.
In the latter case "reg" property is required, and parent node must be specified
as simple bus with the following required properties:

- compatible : Must be "simple-bus"
- #address-cells: Must be 1.
- #size-cells: Must be 0.

Examples:

dvfs_rails {
	compatible = "simple-bus";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	vdd-cpu-rail@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra210-dvfs-rail";
		vdd_cpu-supply = <&pmicxxx_sd0>;
	};

	vdd-core-rail@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra210-dvfs-rail";
		vdd_core-supply = <&pmicxxx_sd1>;
	};

	vdd-gpu-rail@2 {
		reg = <2>;
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra210-dvfs-rail";
		vdd_gpu-supply = <&pmicxxx_sd6>;
	};
};

dvfs_rails {
	compatible = "simple-bus";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	vdd-cpu-rail@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra210-dvfs-rail";
		vdd_cpu-supply = <&cpu_fixed_reg>;
		vdd_cpu_dfll-supply = <&cpu_pwm_reg>;
	};

	vdd-core-rail@1 {
		reg = <1>;
	....
};
