NVIDIA Tegra DFLL clock source data in the SoC DTS file:

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be one of the following
	"nvidia,tegra124-dfll".
	"nvidia,tegra148-dfll".
	"nvidia,tegra114-dfll",
- reg : Must contain the starting physical address and length for the DFLL's
  MMIO register space including the DFLL-to-I2C controller interface and the
  DFLL's I2C controller.
- out-clock-name : Must contain a "dfll_cpu" string, name of the DFLL output
  clock.

Optional properties:
- status : device availability -- managed by the DT integration code.
  Should be set to "disabled" in the SoC DTS file.

Example:

dfll@70110000 {
        compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-dfll";
        reg = <0x70110000 0x400>;
        out-clock-name = "dfll_cpu";
        status = "disabled";
};


NVIDIA Tegra DFLL clock source data in the board DTS file

Required properties:
- board-params : phandle pointing to the board-specific configuration data
  for this DFLL instance.
- i2c-pmic-integration : phandle pointing to the integration data for
  PMIC controlled by this DFLL instance via I2C interface.
Note that after future addition of device tree support for PMIC controlled via
PWM interface, this property become optional and mutually exclusive with
pwm-pmic-integration.

Optional properties:
- i2c-quiet-output-workaround : If the DFLL IP block version implemented on
  this SoC requires the I2C output to the PMIC to be quiesced before disabling
  it, this property should be set.
- monitor-data-new-workaround : If the DFLL IP block version implemented on
  this SoC may erroneously clear DFLL monitor data new indicator, this property
  should be set.
- dynamic-output-lut-workaround : If the DFLL IP block version implemented on
  this SoC does not support dynamic change of DFLL output limits register
  fields, this property should be set.

- status : device availability -- managed by the DT integration code.
  Should be set to "okay" if the DFLL is to be used on this board type.

Example:

dfll@70110000 {
        board-params = <&{/cpu_dfll_board_params}>;
        i2c-pmic-integration = <&{/cpu_dfll_pmic_integration}>;
        status = "okay";
};


DFLL board params node in the board DTS file

Required properties:
- sample-rate : control loop sample rate (in Hz).
- cf : I2C: duration to force the PMIC voltage after frequency change.
- cg : loop gain (signed) - determined during board characterization.
- ci : loop integral gain selector.
- droop-cut-value : DFLL output clock throttle setting at voltage droop event.
- droop-restore-ramp : DFLL clock recovery rate after a voltage droop event.
- scale-out-ramp : DFLL clock output scaling ramp rate.

Optional properties:
- cg-scale : if present, divide loop gain by 8 (see 'cg' above).

- fixed-output-forcing : force PMIC voltage during req change for a fixed time.
- auto-output-forcing : force PMIC voltage during req change for a dynamic time.
- no-output-forcing : don't force PMIC voltage output during request change.
Note that one and only one of 'fixed-output-forcing', or 'auto-output-forcing',
or 'no-output-forcing' must be specified.

Example:

cpu_dfll_board_params {
        sample-rate = <12500>;
        fixed-output-forcing;
        cf = <10>;
        ci = <0>;
        cg = <2>;
        droop-cut-value = <0xf>;
        droop-restore-ramp = <0x0>;
        scale-out-ramp = <0x0>;
};


DFLL I2C PMIC integration node in the board DTS file

Required properties:
- pmic-i2c-address : PMIC I2C bus address.
- pmic-i2c-voltage-register : internal PMIC address of the select-output-voltage
  register (vsel register) for the rail that supplies the DFLL.
- sel-slope : slope coefficient for linear conversion of selector values exposed
  by regulator framework into PMIC vsel register settings.
- i2c-fs-rate : I2C bus rate in Hz, in FS mode.

Optional properties:
- i2c-10-bit-addresses : PMIC requires a 10-bit I2C address.
- i2c-hs-rate : use HS I2C bus mode to communicate with the PMIC, at this rate
  in Hz.
- i2c-hs-master-code : I2C master code to use - only applies in HS mode; must
  be set if i2c-hs-rate is set, ignored otherwise.
- sel-offset : offset coefficient for linear conversion of selector values
  exposed by regulator framework into PMIC vsel register settings (offset zero,
  if not present).
- pmic-undershoot-gb : PMIC undershoot guard-band in mV (zero, if not present).

Example:

cpu_dfll_pmic_integration {
        pmic-i2c-address = <0xb0>;
        pmic-i2c-voltage-register = <0x23>;
        i2c-fs-rate = <400000>;
        sel-conversion-slope = <1>;
        pmic-undershoot-gb = <100>;
